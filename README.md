# neurocti-small

This repository shows you how to use the [neurocti-small](https://huggingface.co/ctitools/neurocti-small) model.

Please note that this is currently still the small model based on llama-3-8B-instruct and we are re-training on a bigger model.
So, it makes sense to try this model out, but then switch to the bigger one to leverage the bigger model's capabilities.
